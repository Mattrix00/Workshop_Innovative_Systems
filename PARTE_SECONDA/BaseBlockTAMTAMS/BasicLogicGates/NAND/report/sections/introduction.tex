In this project we made an analysis and parameters estimation in terms of power and delay of a single logic gate, CMOS NAND-2 inputs. The analysis has been made for different fan-out to check the behaviors of parameters estimated. \\The matlab files implemented for TAMTAM are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item nand-2input\_fanout\_1;
\item nand-2input\_fanout\_2;
\item nand-2input\_fanout\_3;
\item nand-2input\_fanout\_4;
\item nand-2input\_fanout\_n;
\end{itemize}
