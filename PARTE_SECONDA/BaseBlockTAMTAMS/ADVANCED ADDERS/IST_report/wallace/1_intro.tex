\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to implement an advanced \textbf{pipelined model} of a Wallace Tree Adder.

In particular, in the following sections, the generic structure of Wallace Tree will be described in detail and the focus will be on power consumption, occupied area and delay estimation. This particular model allows to introduce a variable number of pipeline stages along the Tree structure: the estimations will therefore take into account the pipeline structure contributions for area, power consumption and total delay.
Calculations have been performed considering, for half adders and full adders, NAND2-based structures while for D flip flops both NAND2 and INV gates.
Matlab implementation has been also reported.
