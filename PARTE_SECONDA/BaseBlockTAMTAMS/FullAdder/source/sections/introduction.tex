The aim of this project is to create a parametrical model to describe the behaviour of the basic components used to realize arithmetical circuits, the half adder and the full adder. In the Theoretical analysis is discussed the general description of both components above mentioned and then the calculation of power consumption, occupied area and timing. The calculations have been executed transforming the logic gates inside the structure in NAND gates; this is a choice made in order to simplify calculations of power and timing. In the Octave implementation is shown the Matlab code used to realize the models. Moreover, two tables, which list the legend of the parameters, have been created in order to help the reader during the reading of this document. The last section concerns the results for each analysis indicated above. The used technological parameters refer to Bulk Technology HP 2009.
