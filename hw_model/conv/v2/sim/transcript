# By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R)
# option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.
# 
# To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo',
# use one of these commands:
#   /usr/bin/rm -- -foo
# 
#   /usr/bin/rm ./-foo
# 
# Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover
# some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater
# assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.
